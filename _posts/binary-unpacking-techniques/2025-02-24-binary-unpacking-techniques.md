[Original article](https://sam0x90.blog/2020/06/06/unpacking-binary-101) changed by me:

This is a quick blog post about how to unpack your first binary, hope you‚Äôll learn something üôÇ I tried to make this article not too long so the techniques covered are fairly basics, but this should get you on track to discover more advanced unpacking techniques.

# What do we mean by ‚Äúpacked‚Äù binary?

First of all, we need to understand what a ‚Äúpacked‚Äù binary is. Basically, a packed binary is an executable file that has been ‚Äúpacked‚Äù by a ‚Äúpacker‚Äù. The end‚Ä¶ 

Using a packer allows the author to concatenate one application (code and data) into a compressed file, which contains a routine to unpack the original executable and run it in memory. This has many purposes:

* Initially used for compression, i.e. to reduce the total size of the executable
* To prevent people from reverse engineering the file. This is done to protect things like license or protect intellectual property
* Finally, this is used by malware author to lower down the detection rate of security tools (AV, EDR, etc.) and also to make the analysis harder (or at least waste some of our time) by incorporating things like anti-reverse techniques and/or obfuscation.

Therefore, packing has both malicious and legitimate use cases, that‚Äôs why you‚Äôve probably heard of commercial or open source packers such as the famous UPX. That‚Äôs the one we will see in a moment.

Here is a visual representation of the high-level process of unpacking to better understand the concept. Note that the packed file is also called ‚Äústub‚Äù.

Of course, we also need to understand the Portable Executable (PE) file format, but for that I recommend you to go through the following:
* [Microsoft - PE Format](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/debug/pe-format)
* [CBJ-2005-74.pdf](/assets/pe/CBJ-2005-74.pdf)
* [Corkami - PE101](/assets/pe/pe101.pdf)
* [Corkami - PE102](/assets/pe/pe102.pdf)

Next, we‚Äôre going to see how to unpack a binary. I‚Äôm not going to cover cases where you can use generic unpacker software or the ‚Äúofficial‚Äù unpacker of the packed binary.

# How can we identify a packed binary?

Now that we know what is a packed binary, we need to understand how can we identify one. We will list some of the well-know techniques below.

## PE Sections

First, reading the section names can gives us indication about the packed file (see the following screenshot from PE Studio, where we can see the sections named UPX0 and UPX1). Be careful as section names can be manually overwritten into something ‚Äúnormal‚Äù or even tricking you into thinking it‚Äôs UPX when it‚Äôs not.

We can also use tools such as CFF Explorer or PEiD that will try to automatically determine what kind of packed file we are facing. Below we can see that CFF Explorer found that the file has been packed with UPX v3.0.

## Import Table

Another good technique to determine if the file is packed, is to have a look at the import table, which should be relatively small as it only uses functions to ‚Äúdecrypt‚Äù or unpack the original file. Here after, we can see the import table of a UPX packed file shown in PE Studio, which is quite short.

</figure>

You might also get a warning in some debuggers, if the file is packed or see only small amount of code being recognized by the disassembler.

Of course there are more techniques that you can use to determine if the file is packed such as the rights of each section (having READ, WRITE and EXECUTE shouldn‚Äôt be the case), having a entry point in another section than the first one, or checking the entropy of the sections to spot encryption, etc.

# How can we find the original entry point?

Ok, we‚Äôve seen how we can identify (simple) packed binaries, now it‚Äôs time to unpack it, but first we need to retrieve the original entry point. From now on, the example used is the ‚Äúunpackme_UPX‚Äù binary that you can found by googling around.

So the goal here will be to partially execute the binary, indeed, we will need the packed binary to go through its unpacking/decrypting routine and stop the execution at the entry point of the original binary. This what we call : Finding the Original Entry Point (aka OEP).

Again there are tons of techniques available to determine the original entry point, but here are some of them.

## Browsing

‚ÄúBrowsing‚Äù the code manually to find the OEP of well-known compilers. For example, the first API call of the Microsoft Visual C++ version 6 compiler is the ‚ÄúGetVersion‚Äù API call, therefore we can try to find it manually by browsing the code. Here below is a example of how the pattern looks like in OllyDbg for this particular compiler.
